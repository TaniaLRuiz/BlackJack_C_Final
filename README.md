# BlackJack_C_Final

Introduction to C introduces undergraduate students to the fundamental principles of programming for solving engineering programs, using the C programming language. It familiarizes students with the process of computational thinking and the translation of real-life engineering problems to computation problems. Further, it describes the basic techniques for systematic software design. It provides fundamental knowledge in basic programming concepts such as program flow control, memory management, and elementary data structures.

For this project, students were allowed to work in a team of two or create the code by themselves. In this case, this code was created in conjuction with another classmate.
